# 24-7-YouTube-Twitch-Stream
Code made in node.js.
#1 Step go to the **live.sh** add find .mp3 radio station or make your own in Zeno.fm.
#2 If you want to stream on YouTube change RTMP. If you want to stream on Twitch just replace {} with your stream key. If you want to run this project on Replit you need to change .gif, .png, .jpg to .mp4 and you dont need to have nice quality picture bacuse CPU is really bad.
You can also change RTMP server on this website: **https://stream.twitch.tv/ingests/**
